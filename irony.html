  <h1>Irony, A Curated Collection</h1>
  <footer>By Matthew Sams</footer>

<div class="bigcards">
  <h2>Situational Irony</h2>

    <p class="para">This meme is an example of situational irony because the sticker reads as "come and take it" and in the next image it shows the exact spot where the sticker was is gone.</p>

  <div class="bigcards">
    <h2>Verbal irony</h2>

      <p class="para">This clip from Spongebob Squarepants is an example of verbal irony because the extra character opens the toilet seat to see Spongebob is just a regular sponge in that clip, which we can assume is a joke for feces being lefted in a toilet. The extra then replies with "Oh that's REAL nice." and leaves the stall, detailing that it was sarcasm. <a href="https://youtu.be/yVB-qAP9HX4">Source</a></p>

    <h2>Dramatic irony</h2>

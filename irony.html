  <h1>Irony, A Curated Collection</h1>
  <footer>By Matthew Sams</footer>
<p class="bo">In this collection, I have various different sources pointing to different types of irony.</p>
<div class="bigcards">
  <h2>Situational Irony</h2>

    <p class="para">This meme is an example of situational irony because the sticker reads as "come and take it" and in the next image it shows the exact spot where the sticker was is gone.</p>

  <div class="bigcards">
    <h2>Verbal irony</h2>

      <p class="para">This clip from Spongebob Squarepants is an example of verbal irony because the extra character opens the toilet seat to see Spongebob is just a regular sponge in that clip, which we can assume is a joke for feces being lefted in a toilet. The extra then replies with "Oh that's REAL nice." and leaves the stall, detailing that it was sarcasm. <a href="https://youtu.be/yVB-qAP9HX4">Source</a></p>

    <h2>Dramatic irony</h2>

    <p class="para">This video clips shows an active duty woman playing a game with Jimmy Fallon, she thinks her husband, who is an active duty soldier, is still deployed. Midway into the game though, it is revealed that her husband isn't deployed and is standing behind her. the audience sees him, but the wife doesn't catch on until Jimmy shows her what the card reads. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYMF5mhuBUE">Source</p>
